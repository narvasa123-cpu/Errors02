## 🌟 How It Works

### 1. Farmer Input
```javascript
// Farmer selects location and crop
const farmData = {
  location: "Valencia City, Bukidnon",
  cropType: "corn",
  currentStage: "planting",
  coordinates: { lat: 7.9064, lon: 125.0945 }
};
```

### 2. NASA Data Retrieval
```javascript
// Fetch comprehensive agricultural data
const analysis = await nasaAgriculturalService.getAgriculturalAnalysis(
  lat, lon, cropType, currentStage, targetDate
);
```

### 3. Smart Recommendations
```javascript
// Generate actionable insights
const recommendations = {
  irrigation: "Apply 25-30mm water immediately",
  planting: "Delay planting by 3-5 days due to heavy rain",
  harvesting: "Harvest early - strong winds predicted"
};
```

### 4. Alert System
```javascript
// Send PWD-friendly notifications
if (soilMoisture < 20%) {
  alertService.sendVoiceAlert({
    message: "Irrigation needed. Soil moisture critically low.",
    severity: "urgent"
  });
}
```

## 📊 Sample Analysis Output

### Overall Conditions Score: 85/100 ✅
- **Temperature**: 28°C (Optimal for corn)
- **Soil Moisture**: 32% (Good range)
